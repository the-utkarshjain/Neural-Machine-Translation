# Neural Machine Translation

Framework: PyTorch

Repository contaning my implementation of the three important papers in machine translation task:
1. ["Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" paper by Sutskever et. al (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)
2. ["Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" paper by Bahdanau et. al (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)
3. ["Attention Is All You Need paper" by Vaswani et. al (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
